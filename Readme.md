Hello World in Swift

First thing I realized is that Xcode was not properly pulling from GitHub. This means that there's a conflict when you create  the .gitignore and Readme.md in the github repository and then try to push the Xcode project up. So I had to make .gitignore and Readme via Xcode.
The confusing part was that when I made the .gitignore, Xcode would not display it in the file browser because it's a Hidden file. Therefore I had to then go into the terminal, open it via vim and paste a proper .gitignore  list generated with http://gitignore.io
